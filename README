columnmove serves you several keymappings specialized for moving cursor in vertical direction.

*** columnmove-f and its variants ***
columnmove-f and its variants are the commands for bringing cursor to the position assigned by a character in the same column. This group has six keymappings, that is, "columnmove-f", "columnmove-t", "columnmove-F", "columnmove-T", "columnmove-;", "columnmove-,".  Each of them are the imitations of "f", "t", "F", "T", ";", "," command, but work in vertical direction, not in line-wise.

*** columnmove-w and its variants ***
columnmove-w and its variants are the commands for moving cursor in word-wise. This group has four keymappings, that is, "columnmove-w", "columnmove-b", "columnmove-e", "columnmove-ge". Each of them are the imitations of "w", "b", "e", "ge", but work in vertical direction. These commands regard the column which cursor is on as a line and search for the head or tail of word to move.
